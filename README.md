### Report recent progress
Dropbox has problem reporting overall recent progress to everyone, only modification on the docs you edited & commented are notified.

We tried to solve this problem with Dropbox Paper API, but it's not very comprehensive yet. But as hinted in [https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-sdk-python/issues/108](https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-sdk-python/issues/108), we can get revision number by exporting the results. With this information (revision number) and cached results, we can approximately get the functions we need.
